## General AWS Exam Technique

The AWS SAA-C03 exam requires strategic approach to maximize your chances of success. Understanding the exam structure and developing effective techniques is crucial.

### Exam Question Distribution

- **25% Easy Questions** - Straightforward knowledge-based questions
- **50% Medium Questions** - Scenario-based requiring analysis
- **25% Hard Questions** - Complex scenarios requiring deep understanding

### Three-Phase Approach

**Phase 1: Easy Questions (First Pass)**
- Tackle straightforward questions immediately
- Build confidence and secure easy points
- Don't overthink simple questions

**Phase 2: Medium Questions (Second Pass)**
- Review remaining questions systematically
- **Mark difficult questions for review** - don't spend too much time initially
- Focus on questions you can solve with moderate effort

**Phase 3: Hard Questions (Final Focus)**
- Use remaining time on marked questions
- Apply elimination techniques
- Make educated guesses if necessary

### Time Management Strategy

**Critical Time Tips:**
- **Assume you will run out of time** on your first attempt
- Target **2 minutes per question** maximum
- **Don't guess until the end** - later questions may trigger memories
- **Use "Mark for Review" extensively** ❗

**Preparation Requirements:**
- Take **ALL available practice tests**
- Aim for **90%+ on practice tests** before taking the real exam
- Practice time management during mock exams

## Question Analysis Technique

> *Follow a systematic process to identify key elements, eliminate distractors, and improve your accuracy rate.*

### Question Structure Understanding

**Typical AWS Question Format:**
- **1-2 lines of scenario/preamble** - Sets the context
- **The actual question** - What they're asking
- **4-5 answer choices** - Usually multiple choice or multi-select
- **Generally one clearly correct answer** at associate level
- Occasionally **"most suitable"** among several valid options

### Systematic Elimination Process

**Step 1: Identify Common Criteria**
Most questions have an overall restriction or requirement:
- **Cost-effective** - Choose cheaper options when functionality is similar
- **Best Practice Security** - Follow AWS recommended security practices
- **Highest Performance** - Direct Connect > Site-to-Site VPN > Internet
- **Timeframe constraints** - Immediate vs. eventual consistency

**Step 2: Eliminate Obviously Wrong Answers**
- Look for **1-2 answers that can be immediately excluded**
- Remove options that don't match the scenario requirements
- Eliminate services that don't fit the use case

**Step 3: Focus on What Matters**
- **Highlight key requirements** in the question
- **Remove question fluff** - ignore irrelevant details
- **Identify critical elements** in answer choices
- Focus on the core problem being solved

### Common Question Patterns

**Security Best Practices:**
- Use **IAM roles** instead of access keys when possible
- Choose **least privilege** access principles
- Prefer **AWS managed services** for security

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Direct Connect > VPN > Internet** for connectivity
- **Regional services > Cross-region** for latency
- **Caching solutions** for read-heavy workloads

**Cost Optimization:**
- **Reserved Instances** for predictable workloads
- **Spot Instances** for fault-tolerant applications
- **S3 storage classes** based on access patterns

### When You're Stuck

**Emergency Strategy:**
- **DON'T PANIC** - mark for review and move on
- **Come back later** - other questions may provide hints
- **Use elimination** to narrow down to 2 choices
- **Make educated guess** based on AWS best practices

## Key Exam Tips

The following key points are commonly tested in the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam:

### IAM and Security
- IAM is a **globally resilient** service - data is replicated across all AWS regions
- Root user has **full access** and cannot be restricted - secure it with MFA
- IAM Access Keys consist of two parts: Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
- The IAM policy evaluation priority order is: **1) Explicit DENY, 2) Explicit ALLOW, 3) Default DENY**
- IAM Roles use temporary credentials via the Secure Token Service (STS)

### VPC Networking
- Default VPC CIDR is always **172.31.0.0/16**
- Security Groups are **stateful** (return traffic is automatically allowed)
- NACLs are **stateless** (return traffic must be explicitly allowed)
- Each subnet is in exactly one Availability Zone and cannot span AZs

### EC2 and Compute
- EC2 is AZ resilient - an instance fails if its AZ fails
- EC2 On-Demand billing is **per second**
- Only EBS storage is billed when an EC2 instance is stopped

### S3 Storage
- S3 bucket names must be **globally unique**
- Objects can be 0 bytes to 5 TB in size
- S3 has a flat structure - folders are just prefixes in object keys
- Versioning cannot be disabled once enabled (only suspended)
- S3 Standard-IA and One Zone-IA have retrieval fees and minimum duration charges

### CloudFormation
- CloudFormation templates use either YAML or JSON format
- Stack deletion removes all resources created by the stack
- StackSets extend functionality to multiple accounts and regions

### Route 53 and DNS
- Route 53 is a **globally resilient** service
- TTL (Time To Live) controls how long DNS records are cached
- A records map hostnames to IPv4 addresses
- CNAME records map one hostname to another hostname

### High Availability vs Fault-Tolerance
- High Availability (HA) focuses on **maximizing system uptime**
- Fault-Tolerance (FT) enables **continuous operation despite component failures**
- Disaster Recovery (DR) involves **recovery plans for catastrophic failures**

### CloudWatch and Monitoring
- CloudWatch Metrics use namespaces to organize data points
- CloudWatch Alarms have three states: OK, ALARM, and INSUFFICIENT_DATA
- CloudWatch Agent is required for OS-level metrics from EC2 instances
