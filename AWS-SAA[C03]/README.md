## 3. AWS Core Concepts

### Shared Responsibility Model

- AWS is responsible for security **of** the cloud (hardware, software, networking, facilities).
- Customer is responsible for security **in** the cloud (data, identity, applications, OS, network config).
- **Exam Tip:** Know which responsibilities belong to AWS vs. the customer for different services (e.g., EC2 vs S3).

### AWS Global Infrastructure

- **Regions:** Isolated geographic areas (e.g., us-east-1).
- **Availability Zones (AZs):** Isolated locations within a region.
- **Edge Locations:** Used for CDN (CloudFront), DNS (Route 53), and caching.
- **Exam Tip:** Some services are global (IAM, Route 53), some are regional (EC2, S3), some are AZ-scoped (EBS).

### Pricing Models

- **On-Demand:** Pay for compute/storage by the hour/second with no long-term commitment.
- **Reserved:** Commit to 1 or 3 years for significant discount.
- **Spot:** Bid for unused capacity at steep discounts (can be interrupted).
- **Savings Plans:** Flexible pricing for compute usage.

## 4. Compute Services

### Amazon EC2

[Back to Service Index](#aws-service-quick-index)

- **What:** Virtual machines (instances) in the cloud. Supports multiple OS, sizes, and purchasing options.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Instance types (general, compute, memory, storage optimized)
  - AMI (Amazon Machine Image): Template for launching instances
  - Security Groups: Virtual firewalls for instances
  - EBS: Persistent block storage
  - Lifecycle: Running, stopped, terminated
- **Exam Tips:**
  - Only EBS is billed when instance is stopped
  - Security Groups are stateful, NACLs are stateless
  - Use IAM roles for EC2 to avoid hardcoding credentials

### AWS Lambda (Expanded)

[Back to Service Index](#aws-service-quick-index)

- **What:** Serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Supported runtimes: Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Ruby, .NET

- **Exam Tips:**
  - ECS vs EKS: ECS is AWS proprietary, EKS is managed Kubernetes
  - Fargate removes the need to manage underlying EC2 instances
  - ECS Task Roles vs. Instance Roles: Task roles provide permissions to specific containers

### Fargate

[Back to Service Index](#aws-service-quick-index)

- **What:** Serverless compute engine for containers that works with both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - No EC2 instances to manage - AWS handles the underlying infrastructure
  - Pay only for the resources allocated to containers while they're running
  - Tasks are injected into your VPC with their own Elastic Network Interface (ENI)
  - 20 GB of ephemeral storage included with each task
- **Exam Tips:**
  - Use for small/burst workloads or batch/periodic processing to optimize costs
  - Ideal when you want to focus on application design rather than infrastructure management
  - Best choice for overhead-conscious large workloads, while EC2 mode is better for price-conscious large workloads
  - Integrates with IAM for task-level security through Task Roles

### Auto Scaling Groups

[Back to Service Index](#aws-service-quick-index)

- **What:** Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Launch Templates/Configurations define the EC2 instance settings
  - Scaling Policies determine when to scale out (add instances) or in (remove instances)
  - Cooldown periods prevent rapid scaling fluctuations
  - Integration with ELB ensures traffic is properly distributed

- **Scaling Types:**
  - Simple scaling: based on a single metric (e.g., CPU utilization)
  - Step scaling: variable adjustment based on metric magnitude
  - Target tracking: maintains a specific metric value (e.g., 70% CPU utilization)
  - Scheduled scaling: predetermined scaling based on time
  - Predictive scaling: ML-powered scaling based on patterns and forecasts

- **Exam Tips:**
  - Multi-AZ deployment increases availability
  - Warm-up time allows instances to initialize before receiving traffic
  - Health checks determine instance health and replacement
  - Instance protection prevents specific instances from termination

### Elastic Beanstalk

[Back to Service Index](#aws-service-quick-index)

- **What:** A fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy and run applications in multiple languages without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

- **Key Concepts:**
  - Platform as a Service (PaaS) - handles deployment, capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring
  - Supports multiple languages and platforms: Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker
  - Includes web server environments (Apache, Nginx, IIS) and application server environments
  - Maintains multiple versions of your application for easy rollbacks
  - Integrates with CloudWatch for monitoring and X-Ray for tracing

- **Exam Tips:**
  - Use for quickly deploying web applications without managing infrastructure
  - Elastic Beanstalk is free (you only pay for the underlying AWS resources)
  - Two environment types: Web Server Environment and Worker Environment
  - Supports deployment of application versions with zero downtime using rolling updates
  - You can customize the environment using configuration files (.ebextensions)
  - Perfect for developers who want to focus on writing code rather than managing infrastructure

    - **Private Subnets**: No direct route to the internet
  - **Route Tables**: Control the traffic flow between subnets and gateways
  - **Internet Gateway (IGW)**: Allows communication between your VPC and the internet
  - **NAT Gateway/NAT Instance**: Enables private subnet resources to access the internet
  - **Security Groups**: Virtual firewalls for EC2 instances (stateful)
  - **Network ACLs**: Firewall for subnets (stateless)
  - **VPC Endpoints**: Private connections to AWS services without traversing the internet
    - **Gateway Endpoints**: For S3 and DynamoDB

- **Limitations**:
  - Maximum of 5 VPCs per region (default limit, can be increased)
  - Maximum of 200 subnets per VPC
  - CIDR block size between /16 (65,536 IPs) and /28 (16 IPs)
  
- **Exam Tips:**
  - Remember the differences between stateful security groups and stateless NACLs
  - Understand the routing principles and how different components interact

  - Choose NLB for highest performance, static IPs, or non-HTTP protocols
  - Choose GWLB for deploying security appliances and traffic inspection
  - Load balancers operate in multiple AZs for high availability
  - ALB terminates HTTPS connections; NLB allows end-to-end encryption
  - Internal load balancers have only private IPs; internet-facing have public IPs
  - Target groups can include EC2 instances, IP addresses, Lambda functions, or containers

  - Use VPC endpoints for private access
  - Monitor access patterns with CloudTrail
  - Use cross-region replication for critical secrets
  - Tag secrets for cost allocation and organization

- **Exam Tips:**
  - Secrets Manager provides automatic rotation, Parameter Store does not
  - Rotation works by creating new credentials before deleting old ones
  - More expensive than Parameter Store but provides additional security features
  - Integrates natively with RDS, Aurora, Redshift for automatic credential rotation
  - Use when compliance requires audit trails and automatic credential rotation
  - Cross-region replication helps with disaster recovery scenarios

    - May not check all servers
    - Higher cost due to more API calls
  
  - **Long Polling**:
    - Waits for messages up to 20 seconds
    - Checks all servers
    - Reduces cost and eliminates empty responses
    - Set ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds > 0

  - **Message Filtering**: Use SNS message filtering before SQS delivery
  - **Appropriate Retention**: Set retention period based on processing needs

- **Use Cases:**
  - Decoupling microservices and distributed applications
  - Processing background jobs and tasks
  - Buffering writes to databases or external APIs
  - Handling traffic spikes and load leveling

  - Event-driven architectures

- **Exam Tips:**
  - Standard queues: high throughput, at-least-once delivery, best-effort ordering
  - FIFO queues: exact order, exactly-once processing, lower throughput
  - Use DLQs to handle failed message processing
  - Long polling reduces cost and latency
  - Maximum message size is 256 KB (use S3 for larger payloads)
  - Visibility timeout should be longer than function execution time
  - Can't change queue type after creation (Standard to FIFO or vice versa)
