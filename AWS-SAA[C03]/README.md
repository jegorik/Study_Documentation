## 3. AWS Core Concepts

### Shared Responsibility Model

- AWS is responsible for security **of** the cloud (hardware, software, networking, facilities).
- Customer is responsible for security **in** the cloud (data, identity, applications, OS, network config).
- **Exam Tip:** Know which responsibilities belong to AWS vs. the customer for different services (e.g., EC2 vs S3).

### AWS Global Infrastructure

- **Regions:** Isolated geographic areas (e.g., us-east-1).
- **Availability Zones (AZs):** Isolated locations within a region.
- **Edge Locations:** Used for CDN (CloudFront), DNS (Route 53), and caching.
- **Exam Tip:** Some services are global (IAM, Route 53), some are regional (EC2, S3), some are AZ-scoped (EBS).

### Pricing Models

- **On-Demand:** Pay for compute/storage by the hour/second with no long-term commitment.
- **Reserved:** Commit to 1 or 3 years for significant discount.
- **Spot:** Bid for unused capacity at steep discounts (can be interrupted).
