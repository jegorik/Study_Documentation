## 3. AWS Core Concepts

### Shared Responsibility Model

- AWS is responsible for security **of** the cloud (hardware, software, networking, facilities).
- Customer is responsible for security **in** the cloud (data, identity, applications, OS, network config).
- **Exam Tip:** Know which responsibilities belong to AWS vs. the customer for different services (e.g., EC2 vs S3).

### AWS Global Infrastructure

- **Regions:** Isolated geographic areas (e.g., us-east-1).
- **Availability Zones (AZs):** Isolated locations within a region.
- **Edge Locations:** Used for CDN (CloudFront), DNS (Route 53), and caching.
- **Exam Tip:** Some services are global (IAM, Route 53), some are regional (EC2, S3), some are AZ-scoped (EBS).

### Pricing Models

- **On-Demand:** Pay for compute/storage by the hour/second with no long-term commitment.
- **Reserved:** Commit to 1 or 3 years for significant discount.
- **Spot:** Bid for unused capacity at steep discounts (can be interrupted).
- **Savings Plans:** Flexible pricing for compute usage.

  - Does not eliminate service-specific backup options, but provides a unified management layer

## Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

[Back to Service Index](#aws-service-quick-index)

- **What:** A service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses.

- **Types of Load Balancers:**
  - **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** - Layer 7 load balancer for HTTP/HTTPS traffic
  - **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** - Layer 4 load balancer for TCP, TLS, UDP traffic
  - **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)** - For deploying, scaling, and managing third-party virtual appliances
  - **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)** - Legacy load balancer (not recommended for new implementations)

- **Application Load Balancer (ALB):**
  - Works at Layer 7 (application layer)
  - Content-based routing with rules based on HTTP headers, paths, host headers
  - Support for WebSockets
  - HTTP/HTTPS traffic only (SSL termination)
  - Can route to multiple target groups based on URL paths or host headers
  - Integrates with AWS WAF for application-level protection
  - Slower than NLB but more feature-rich for HTTP/HTTPS applications

- **Network Load Balancer (NLB):**
  - Works at Layer 4 (transport layer)
  - Handles millions of requests per second with ultra-low latency
  - Supports static IP addresses for each AZ and elastic IP addresses
  - Preserves source IP address of clients
  - Supports TCP, UDP, TLS protocols
  - Ideal for non-HTTP protocols (SMTP, SSH, game servers, financial apps)
  - Supports unbroken encryption (end-to-end TLS)

- **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB):**
  - Helps deploy, scale, and manage third-party virtual appliances
  - Examples: firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, deep packet inspection
  - Uses GENEVE protocol (port 6081)
  - Combines functions of a transparent network gateway and load balancer
  - Works with GWLB endpoints to route traffic to/from virtual appliances

- **Common Features:**
  - Health checks to ensure traffic is only sent to healthy targets
  - Integration with Auto Scaling Groups
  - Support for sticky sessions (session affinity)
  - Cross-zone load balancing for even distribution across AZs
  - Access logs to S3 for detailed connection information
  - Connection draining (deregistration delay) for graceful target removal

- **Exam Tips:**
  - Choose ALB for HTTP/HTTPS applications and content-based routing
  - Choose NLB for highest performance, static IPs, or non-HTTP protocols
  - Choose GWLB for deploying security appliances and traffic inspection
  - Load balancers operate in multiple AZs for high availability
  - ALB terminates HTTPS connections; NLB allows end-to-end encryption
  - Internal load balancers have only private IPs; internet-facing have public IPs
  - Target groups can include EC2 instances, IP addresses, Lambda functions, or containers
