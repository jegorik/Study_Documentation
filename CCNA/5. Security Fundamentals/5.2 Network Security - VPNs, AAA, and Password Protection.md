# üìò CCNA Topic: Network Security - VPNs, AAA, and Password Protection

## üìù Description:
Network security is a critical aspect of modern network infrastructure, protecting organizations from unauthorized access and data breaches. This topic covers three key components: Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for secure communication over public networks, Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) for access control and management, and Password Protection techniques to secure credentials and access points. Understanding these security technologies and their implementation is essential for maintaining network integrity and confidentiality, and forms a core component of the CCNA certification exam.

      - Provides authentication, integrity, confidentiality
      - Components: AH (Authentication Header), ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)
      - Modes: Transport (payload only) and Tunnel (entire packet)
      - Key management: IKEv1 and IKEv2 (Internet Key Exchange)
    
    - **SSL/TLS VPNs**:
      - Uses SSL/TLS protocol for security
      - Often clientless (web-based)
      - Operates at application layer
      - Easier to deploy than traditional IPsec
      - Types: Portal VPN and Tunnel VPN
    
    - **L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol)**:

      - Simple tunneling protocol without encryption
      - Often combined with IPsec for security
      - Supports multicast and broadcast traffic
      - Enables routing protocols through tunnels
  
  - **IPsec Components and Operation**:
    - **Security Associations (SA)**:
      - One-way relationship between sender and receiver
      - Defined by SPI, IP destination address, and security protocol
      - Contains encryption algorithms, keys, and lifetimes
    
    - **IKE Phases**:
      - **Phase 1**: Authenticates peers, establishes secure channel
      - **Phase 2**: Negotiates IPsec SAs, creates tunnels
      - IKEv2 combines functions into fewer exchanges
    
    - **Authentication Methods**:
      - Pre-shared Keys (PSK)
      - Digital Certificates
      - RSA encrypted nonces
      - EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)
    
    - **Encryption and Hashing Algorithms**:
      - Encryption: AES, 3DES, DES (legacy)
      - Integrity: HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-SHA256, HMAC-MD5 (legacy)
      - DH Groups: Determine key strength for exchanges

### **Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)**:
  - **AAA Fundamentals**:
    - **Authentication**: Verifies user identity (who you are)
    - **Authorization**: Determines allowed actions (what you can do)
    - **Accounting**: Records user actions (what you did)
    - **Benefits**: Centralized access control, granular permissions, audit trail
    - **Implementation**: Local or server-based (RADIUS, TACACS+)
  
  - **Authentication Methods**:
    - **Local Authentication**:
      - User credentials stored on the device
      - Limited scalability and management
      - Useful as fallback mechanism
      - Configuration via username/password commands
    
    - **Server-Based Authentication**:
      - Centralized user database
      - Scalable for large environments
      - Consistent policy enforcement
      - Types: RADIUS, TACACS+, LDAP, Kerberos
    
    - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
      - Combines multiple authentication types
      - Categories: something you know, have, are
      - Examples: password + token, biometrics + PIN
      - Significantly increases security
  
  - **AAA Protocols**:
    - **TACACS+ (Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus)**:
      - Cisco proprietary protocol
      - TCP-based (port 49)
      - Encrypts entire packet
      - Separates authentication, authorization, accounting
      - Offers command-level authorization
      - Best for device administration
    
    - **RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)**:
      - Open standard protocol
      - UDP-based (ports 1812/1813 or 1645/1646 legacy)
      - Encrypts only password field
      - Combines authentication and authorization
      - Widely supported across vendors
      - Common for network access control
    
    - **RADIUS vs. TACACS+ Comparison**:
      - Protocol: UDP vs. TCP
      - Encryption: Partial vs. Full
      - AAA Handling: Combined vs. Separate
      - Authorization: Session vs. Command-level
      - Use cases: Network access vs. Device admin
  
  - **AAA Implementation**:
    - **Method Lists**:
      - Named sets of authentication methods
      - Tried in sequence until success or failure
      - Different lists for different services
      - Default lists for services without specific assignment
    
    - **Server Groups**:
      - Logical grouping of AAA servers
      - Provides redundancy and load sharing
      - Can mix server types within implementation

    - **Implementation Levels**: User, device, service, application
  
  - **Password Best Practices**:
    - **Complexity Requirements**:
      - Minimum length (12+ characters recommended)
      - Character diversity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special)
      - Avoid common words and patterns
      - Unpredictability and uniqueness
    
    - **Password Policies**:
      - Regular rotation (balanced with usability)
      - History enforcement (prevent reuse)
      - Account lockout after failed attempts
      - Minimum age requirements
      - Maximum age requirements
    
    - **Password Storage**:
      - Hashing vs. encryption
      - Salting passwords
      - Modern algorithms (bcrypt, PBKDF2, Argon2)
      - Avoid plaintext or reversible storage
  
  - **Password Security on Cisco Devices**:
    - **Password Types**:
      - **Console Password**: Physical access control
      - **VTY (Telnet/SSH) Password**: Remote access control
      - **Enable Password**: Privileged mode access
      - **Enable Secret**: Enhanced privileged mode protection
      - **Username Passwords**: Individual user authentication
    
    - **Password Encryption Types**:

      - **Service Password Encryption**: Encrypts most passwords in config
    
    - **Password Recovery**:
      - Platform-specific procedures
      - Physical access typically required
      - May require reload/reboot
      - Often involves modifying configuration register
      - May result in config loss on some platforms
  
  - **Enhanced Password Security**:
    - **Login Delay**: Slows brute force attempts
    - **Login Block-For**: Temporary lockout after failed attempts
    - **Login Quiet-Mode**: Access restriction during attacks
    - **Password Strength Checking**: Enforces complexity rules
    - **Login Password Retry Lockout**: Account lockout policy

### **Security Integration**:
  - **VPN and AAA Integration**:
