# üìò CCNA Topic: Enterprise Security Fundamentals

## üìù Description:
Enterprise Security Fundamentals encompasses the core security concepts, technologies, and practices essential for protecting network infrastructure, data, and services. This topic covers threat landscapes, security principles, common attack vectors, defense mechanisms, and security implementation strategies. Understanding security fundamentals is crucial for designing, implementing, and maintaining secure networks in today's increasingly complex threat environment. The CCNA examination tests candidates on their knowledge of security concepts, security threat mitigation techniques, and fundamental security technologies that can be deployed in enterprise networks.
