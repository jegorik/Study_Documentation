# üìò CCNA Topic: Network Security - Layer 2 and Wireless LAN Mechanisms

## üìù Description:
Layer 2 and Wireless LAN security mechanisms are crucial for protecting the access layer of networks, which is often the most vulnerable to attacks. This topic covers security features that safeguard switch infrastructure, prevent layer 2 attacks, secure wireless networks, and control device access to the network. Understanding these security mechanisms is essential for implementing defense-in-depth strategies and protecting networks at their most vulnerable points. The CCNA exam tests candidates on their knowledge of these security features, their configuration, verification, and troubleshooting techniques in both wired and wireless network environments.
