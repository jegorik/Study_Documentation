# üìò CCNA Topic: Static Routing Configuration

## üìù Description:
Static routing is a fundamental networking concept where routes are manually configured by network administrators rather than dynamically learned through routing protocols. Static routes provide precise control over network traffic paths, consume minimal router resources, and add security by explicitly defining permitted traffic flows. This topic covers the configuration, verification, and troubleshooting of various types of static routes including standard static routes, default routes, floating static routes, and summary routes. Understanding static routing is essential for building small to medium-sized networks, creating backup paths, and establishing connectivity to stub networks, making it a critical component of the CCNA certification exam.

## üîó Related Concepts (with explanations):

- **Static Route Fundamentals**:
  - **Definition**: Manual route entries configured by the administrator
  - **Syntax**: `ip route [destination_network] [subnet_mask] [next_hop_ip|exit_interface] [administrative_distance] [options]`
  - **Administrative Distance**: Default value of 1 (more trusted than any dynamic protocol except connected routes)
  - **Resource Utilization**: No bandwidth used for routing updates, minimal CPU/memory usage
  - **Scalability**: Suitable for small networks; becomes unmanageable in large networks
  - **Adaptability**: Does not automatically adapt to network changes
  - **Security**: More secure since routes are explicitly defined
  - **Management**: Requires manual updates when network topology changes

- **Types of Static Routes**:
  - **Standard Static Route**:
    - Defines specific destination network and next hop
    - Example: `ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2`
  
  - **Default Static Route**:
    - Matches all destinations not explicitly listed in routing table
    - Used as "route of last resort"
    - Syntax: `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 [next_hop_ip|exit_interface]`
    - IPv6 equivalent: `ipv6 route ::/0 [next_hop_ipv6|exit_interface]`
  
  - **Floating Static Route**:
    - Backup route with higher administrative distance than primary route
    - Only installed in routing table when primary route fails
    - Example: `ip route 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.1.2 150`
  
  - **Fully Specified Static Route**:
    - Specifies both exit interface and next hop address
    - Example: `ip route 192.168.30.0 255.255.255.0 GigabitEthernet0/1 10.0.0.2`
  
  - **Directly Attached Static Route**:
    - Specifies only the exit interface, not next hop
    - Example: `ip route 192.168.40.0 255.255.255.0 GigabitEthernet0/1`
  
  - **Recursive Static Route**:
    - Next hop IP is not directly connected; requires lookup to reach
    - Example: `ip route 192.168.50.0 255.255.255.0 10.9.9.9` (where 10.9.9.9 requires another route lookup)
  
  - **Summary Static Route**:
    - Aggregates multiple contiguous networks into a single route
    - Example: `ip route 172.16.0.0 255.255.0.0 10.0.0.2` (summarizing all 172.16.x.x subnets)
  
  - **Null Route (Black Hole)**:
    - Discards traffic to specified destinations
    - Useful for filtering or preventing routing loops
    - Example: `ip route 172.16.0.0 255.255.0.0 Null0`

- **Next-Hop Options and Resolution**:
  - **Next-Hop IP Address**:
    - Traffic sent to specified IP address
    - Router performs recursive lookup to determine exit interface
    - Recommended approach in most scenarios
    - Example: `ip route 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 192.168.1.2`
  
  - **Exit Interface**:
    - Traffic sent out specified interface
    - Works best on point-to-point interfaces
    - Can cause ARP issues on multi-access networks
    - Example: `ip route 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 GigabitEthernet0/0`
  
  - **Fully Specified Route**:
    - Combines exit interface and next hop
    - Prevents recursive lookups, improving performance
    - Required in some scenarios like MPLS
    - Example: `ip route 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 GigabitEthernet0/0 192.168.1.2`

- **Static Route Options and Parameters**:
  - **Administrative Distance**:
    - Optional parameter that affects route preference
    - Default value of 1 for static routes
    - Used to create backup routes (floating static routes)
    - Example: `ip route 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 192.168.1.2 150`
  
  - **Permanent Flag**:
    - Keeps the route in the routing table even if the next hop becomes unreachable
    - Useful for routes that should never be removed
    - Example: `ip route 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 192.168.1.2 permanent`
  
  - **Name Parameter**:
    - Adds a descriptive name to the static route
    - Enhances documentation and troubleshooting
    - Example: `ip route 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 192.168.1.2 name BRANCH_OFFICE`
  
  - **Track Object**:
    - Links route installation to the state of a tracked object
    - Provides dynamic behavior to static routes
    - Example: `ip route 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 192.168.1.2 track 1`

- **IPv6 Static Routing**:
  - **Basic Syntax**: `ipv6 route [destination_prefix/length] [next_hop_ipv6|exit_interface]`
  - **Link-Local Considerations**: When using link-local addresses, exit interface must be specified
  - **Recursive Lookups**: Functions similarly to IPv4 static routes
  - **Default Route**: `ipv6 route ::/0 [next_hop_ipv6|exit_interface]`
  - **Administrative Distance**: Same principles as IPv4, default AD is 1
  - **Global vs Link-Local Next Hops**: Global addresses don't require exit interface specification
  - **Example**: `ipv6 route 2001:db8::/64 2001:db8:1::2`
  - **Link-Local Example**: `ipv6 route 2001:db8::/64 GigabitEthernet0/0 fe80::2`

- **Static Routing Design Considerations**:
  - **Hub-and-Spoke Topology**:
    - Central hub uses specific routes to each spoke
    - Spokes use default route to the hub
    - Simplifies configuration at remote sites
    - Scales well for adding new spoke sites
  
  - **Stub Networks**:
    - Networks with only one entry/exit point
    - Ideal candidates for static routing
    - Often configured with default route pointing to upstream router
    - Example: Branch offices, small LANs
  
  - **Backup Routes**:
    - Floating static routes provide backup when dynamic routes fail
    - Administrative distance must be higher than primary routing protocol
    - Create redundancy without protocol complexity
    - Useful for backup WAN links or failover scenarios
  
  - **Route Summarization**:
    - Combine multiple contiguous subnets into a single route
    - Reduces routing table size
    - Commonly used at network boundaries
    - Requires careful IP address planning

    - Verify configuration syntax is correct
    - Check that next-hop is reachable
    - Verify no typos in network address or mask
    - Check for duplicate routes with better administrative distance
    - Verify interface referenced in route is up/up
    - Check for route tracking objects that might be down
    - Look for VRF misconfigurations if using VRFs
    - Commands: `show ip route`, `show ip route static`, `ping [next-hop]`
  
  - **Next-Hop Unreachable**:
    - Check physical connectivity to next-hop
    - Verify ARP entry for next-hop exists
    - Check for access lists blocking connectivity
    - Verify routing to reach the next-hop IP
    - Check interface status of exit interface
    - Try tracing path to the next-hop
    - Commands: `show ip arp`, `ping [next-hop]`, `traceroute [next-hop]`, `show interface`

- **Path Selection Issues**:
  - **Traffic Not Following Expected Path**:
    - Verify no more specific routes exist
    - Check administrative distances of competing routes
    - Verify metrics if using multiple routes from same source
    - Look for policy-based routing overrides
    - Check for routing protocol path manipulation
    - Verify CEF forwarding matches routing table
    - Commands: `show ip route [prefix]`, `show ip policy`, `show ip cef [prefix]`
  
  - **Load Balancing Not Working**:
    - Check if routes have exactly the same metrics and AD
    - Verify maximum paths configuration supports desired number
    - Check if traffic type supports the configured load-balancing method
    - Verify CEF is enabled and operational
    - Test with different traffic patterns
    - Commands: `show ip route [prefix]`, `show ip cef [prefix] detail`, `show ip protocols`

- **Floating Static Route Issues**:
  - **Backup Route Not Activated**:
    - Verify primary route has been completely removed from routing table
    - Check administrative distances are configured correctly
    - Verify backup next-hop is reachable
    - Look for route filtering preventing backup route
    - Commands: `show ip route [prefix]`, `debug ip routing`
  
  - **Backup Route Not Deactivated**:
    - Verify primary route has returned to routing table
    - Check for delay in route convergence
    - Look for route flapping scenarios
    - Verify no tracking objects are keeping primary route down
    - Commands: `show ip route [prefix]`, `show ip route summary`, `debug ip routing`

- **Recursive Routing Problems**:
  - **Recursive Lookup Failure**:
    - Verify route to the next-hop exists
