# üìò CCNA Topic: Server Virtualization, Containers, and VRFs

## üìù Description
This topic covers various virtualization technologies essential for modern network environments. Server virtualization allows multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a single physical server. Containers provide lightweight application isolation without the overhead of full virtual machines. Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) enables network segmentation by creating multiple independent routing tables within a single router. These technologies are fundamental to efficient resource utilization, rapid deployment capabilities, multi-tenant environments, and network segmentation strategies. Understanding these concepts is increasingly important for network engineers as the boundaries between traditional networking and virtualized infrastructure continue to blur.
