# üìò CCNA Topic: Basic Switching Concepts and Introducing VLANs

## üìù Description:
Switches are foundational components of modern networks, operating at Layer 2 of the OSI model to create efficient local area networks. This topic covers the core concepts of Ethernet switching, including frame forwarding processes, MAC address tables, and switching methods. It also introduces Virtual LANs (VLANs), which allow network administrators to create logically separate networks on the same physical infrastructure, enhancing security, performance, and management capabilities. Understanding switching and VLANs is essential for designing, implementing, and troubleshooting enterprise networks, and forms a critical component of the CCNA certification exam.

## üîó Related Concepts (with explanations):

- **Ethernet Switching Fundamentals**:
  - **Layer 2 Forwarding**: Switches operate at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model, making forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses rather than IP addresses
  
  - **MAC Address Table**: Also called CAM (Content Addressable Memory) table
    - Associates MAC addresses with specific switch ports
    - Built dynamically by learning source MAC addresses from incoming frames
    - Typical size can support thousands of MAC addresses
    - Default aging time of 300 seconds (5 minutes) for unused entries
    - Used for making intelligent forwarding decisions
  
  - **Switching Methods**:
    - **Store-and-Forward**: Receives entire frame, checks CRC for errors, then forwards (higher latency but catches errors)
    - **Cut-Through**: Begins forwarding after reading destination MAC address (lower latency but forwards corrupt frames)
    - **Fragment-Free**: Hybrid approach that checks first 64 bytes before forwarding
  
  - **Collision Domains**:
    - Each switch port creates a separate collision domain
    - Eliminates collisions in full-duplex connections
    - Significantly improves network performance compared to hubs
  
  - **Broadcast Domains**:
    - All connected ports on a switch belong to the same broadcast domain
    - Broadcasts are forwarded to all ports except the originating port
    - Large broadcast domains can cause performance issues
    - Limited by routers or VLANs

- **Frame Forwarding Process**:
  - **Frame Reception**: Switch receives an Ethernet frame on a port
  - **Source MAC Learning**: Records source MAC address and incoming port in MAC address table
  - **Destination Lookup**: Searches MAC address table for destination MAC address
  - **Forwarding Decision**:
    - **Known Unicast**: If destination MAC is in table, forward only to specific port
    - **Unknown Unicast**: If destination MAC is unknown, flood frame to all ports except the source port
    - **Broadcast**: If destination MAC is broadcast (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF), flood to all ports except the source port
    - **Multicast**: If destination is multicast address, flood to all ports or forward based on multicast configuration
  - **Loop Prevention**: STP/RSTP prevents forwarding loops in redundant topologies

- **VLAN Concepts**:
  - **Definition**: Virtual LANs are logical partitions of a switch that create separate broadcast domains
  
  - **VLAN Benefits**:
    - **Security**: Traffic separation between different user groups
    - **Cost Reduction**: More efficient use of bandwidth and uplinks
    - **Performance**: Smaller broadcast domains reduce unnecessary traffic
    - **Simplified Management**: Logical grouping of users by function instead of location
    - **Flexibility**: Users can move physically while staying in the same logical network
  
  - **VLAN Types**:
    - **Data VLAN**: Normal user traffic
    - **Voice VLAN**: Dedicated to voice traffic, often with QoS
    - **Management VLAN**: For switch management traffic
    - **Native VLAN**: Untagged VLAN on trunk links (typically VLAN 1)
    - **Default VLAN**: VLAN 1, which cannot be deleted or disabled
    - **Private VLAN**: Special configuration for port isolation within a VLAN
  
  - **VLAN Ranges**:
    - **Normal Range**: 1-1005 (stored in vlan.dat)
    - **Extended Range**: 1006-4094 (requires VTP transparent mode)
  
  - **VLAN Assignments**:
    - **Static VLANs**: Manual port-to-VLAN assignments
    - **Dynamic VLANs**: Assignments based on MAC addresses using VMPS (Legacy)
    - **Voice VLAN**: Automatic detection and assignment for IP phones

- **Inter-VLAN Communication**:
  - **Router-on-a-Stick**: Single router interface connected to a trunk port
  - **Layer 3 Switch**: Switch with routing capabilities between VLANs
  - **Switched Virtual Interface (SVI)**: Virtual interfaces on a Layer 3 switch
  - **Subinterfaces**: Logical interfaces on a router that map to different VLANs
  - **Routing Process**: Layer 3 routing required for communication between VLANs

- **Trunking Concepts**:
  - **Trunk Links**: Special ports that carry traffic for multiple VLANs
  
  - **Trunking Protocols**:
    - **IEEE 802.1Q**: Industry standard for VLAN tagging
      - Adds 4-byte tag to Ethernet frame
      - Includes 12-bit VLAN ID field
      - Supports native VLAN concept
    - **ISL (Inter-Switch Link)**: Cisco proprietary protocol (legacy)
      - Encapsulates the entire frame
      - Does not support native VLAN concept
      - No longer supported on newer Cisco switches
  
  - **Native VLAN**: 
    - Frames on the native VLAN are sent untagged across trunk
    - Native VLAN mismatch can create security vulnerabilities
    - Best practice is to use an unused VLAN as native VLAN
  
  - **DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol)**:
    - Cisco proprietary protocol
    - Negotiates trunk formation between switches
    - Modes: auto, desirable, on, off, nonegotiate

- **VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)**:
  - **Purpose**: Maintains VLAN configuration consistency across a network
  - **Domains**: Administrative domains for VTP management
  - **Modes**:
    - **Server**: Creates, modifies, and deletes VLANs for the domain
    - **Client**: Receives and forwards VTP updates but cannot modify VLANs
    - **Transparent**: Passes VTP updates but doesn't process them
    - **Off**: Doesn't participate in VTP (newer switch versions)
  - **Versions**: VTP v1, v2, and v3 (with enhanced features)
  - **Configuration Revision Number**: Determines which configuration is newer
  - **VTP Pruning**: Restricts broadcast traffic to switches with active VLANs

- **Ethernet Frame Tagging**:
  - **Purpose**: Identifies VLAN membership within Ethernet frames
  - **802.1Q Tag Components**:
    - **TPID (Tag Protocol Identifier)**: 16 bits, set to 0x8100
    - **PCP (Priority Code Point)**: 3 bits for QoS (802.1p priority)
    - **CFI (Canonical Format Indicator)**: 1 bit
    - **VID (VLAN Identifier)**: 12 bits for VLAN number (0-4095)
  - **Tag Location**: Inserted between source MAC address and EtherType fields
  - **Frame Size Impact**: Tagged frames can be up to 1522 bytes (vs. 1518 for untagged)

## ‚úÖ Best Practices:

- **Switch Configuration Best Practices**:
  - Change default passwords and use strong authentication
  - Disable unused physical ports
  - Use secure management protocols (SSH instead of Telnet)
  - Set appropriate port speed and duplex settings
  - Implement port security on access ports
  - Configure descriptions on all interfaces
  - Use SNMPv3 for network management
  - Regularly back up switch configurations
  - Update switch firmware to address security vulnerabilities
  - Configure console and VTY timeouts
  - Implement logging to a central syslog server
  - Use NTP for consistent time settings

- **VLAN Design Considerations**:
  - Avoid using VLAN 1 for user traffic
  - Change the native VLAN to something other than VLAN 1
  - Create dedicated VLANs for management, voice, data, and guests
  - Use meaningful VLAN names that reflect their purpose
  - Document VLAN assignments and IP addressing
  - Limit broadcast domains to appropriate size (250-500 devices max per VLAN)
  - Use VLANs that align with security requirements and traffic patterns
  - Consider traffic volume when assigning devices to VLANs
  - Keep VLAN design consistent across the network
  - Use extended range VLANs only when necessary
  - Reserve VLANs for future expansion

- **Trunk Configuration Best Practices**:
  - Explicitly configure trunk modes rather than relying on auto negotiation
  - Disable DTP on ports connecting to non-Cisco devices
  - Prune unnecessary VLANs from trunks
  - Set native VLAN to an unused VLAN ID
  - Consider using VLAN tagging for all VLANs (including native)
  - Document trunk configurations
  - Monitor trunk utilization and errors
  - Use 802.1Q instead of ISL for compatibility
  - Include only necessary VLANs on each trunk
  - Implement security best practices on trunk ports

- **VTP Usage Guidelines**:
  - Consider using VTP transparent mode or VTP version 3
  - Use VTP domains to isolate network segments
  - Implement VTP passwords to prevent unauthorized additions
  - Document VTP domain names and passwords
  - Be cautious with configuration revision numbers when adding new switches
  - Clear VLAN database before connecting new switches to the network
  - Monitor VTP status and changes
  - Consider disabling VTP (mode off) for small or critical networks

- **Switch Connectivity Issues**:
  - **Port Status Problems**:
    - Check physical connectivity (cables and connections)
    - Verify port status with `show interfaces status`
    - Check for port errors with `show interfaces`
    - Look for speed/duplex mismatches
    - Verify port is not administratively disabled
    - Check for STP blocking state with `show spanning-tree interface`
    - Verify port security hasn't disabled the port
    - Test with different cables and ports to isolate hardware issues
    - Commands: `show interfaces status`, `show interfaces`, `show spanning-tree`
  
  - **MAC Address Table Issues**:
    - Verify MAC address learning with `show mac address-table`
    - Check for MAC address flapping between ports
    - Verify aging time settings with `show mac address-table aging-time`
    - Check for maximum MAC address table size limitations
    - Look for static MAC address entries that might be incorrect
    - Commands: `show mac address-table`, `show mac address-table count`, `clear mac address-table dynamic`

- **VLAN Configuration Problems**:
  - **Port VLAN Assignment Issues**:
    - Verify port VLAN assignment with `show vlan brief`
    - Check interface configuration with `show running-config interface`
    - Ensure VLAN exists in the VLAN database
    - Verify trunk port configuration for trunk links
    - Check for voice VLAN configuration if using IP phones
    - Look for switchport mode configuration (access vs. trunk)
    - Commands: `show vlan brief`, `show interfaces switchport`, `show running-config interface`
  
  - **VLAN Database Issues**:
    - Verify VLAN exists with `show vlan`
    - Check VTP mode and operation with `show vtp status`
    - Verify vlan.dat file integrity
    - Look for VLAN inconsistencies across switches
    - Check extended range VLAN configuration
    - Ensure switch is in appropriate VTP mode for VLAN creation
    - Commands: `show vlan`, `show vtp status`, `delete flash:vlan.dat` (caution!)

- **Trunk Configuration Issues**:
  - **Trunk Establishment Problems**:
    - Verify trunk status with `show interfaces trunk`
    - Check DTP settings on both switches
    - Ensure compatible trunking modes on both ends
    - Verify supported VLAN list on the trunk
    - Check for native VLAN mismatches
    - Verify interface switchport mode
    - Look for encapsulation mismatches (dot1q vs ISL)
    - Commands: `show interfaces trunk`, `show interfaces switchport`
  
  - **VLAN Pruning and Allowed VLANs**:
    - Check allowed VLANs on the trunk with `show interfaces trunk`
    - Verify VLANs are not being pruned unexpectedly
    - Ensure required VLANs are in the allowed list
    - Check for manual pruning configuration
    - Verify VTP pruning configuration if using VTP
    - Commands: `show interfaces trunk`, `show vtp status`

- **Inter-VLAN Routing Problems**:
  - **Router-on-a-Stick Issues**:
    - Verify subinterface configuration
    - Check encapsulation type and VLAN ID
    - Ensure IP addressing is correct for each VLAN
    - Verify trunk configuration on the switch side
    - Test connectivity within each VLAN first
    - Check routing table for expected networks
