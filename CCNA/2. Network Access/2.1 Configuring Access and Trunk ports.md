# üìò CCNA Topic: Configuring Access and Trunk Ports

## üìù Description:
Access and trunk ports are the two primary interface modes on Cisco switches that facilitate VLAN implementation. Access ports connect end devices and belong to a single VLAN, while trunk ports carry traffic for multiple VLANs between switches and other network devices. Understanding how to properly configure, verify, and troubleshoot these port types is essential for implementing VLANs in enterprise networks. This topic covers the configuration commands, best practices, verification techniques, and troubleshooting methods for access and trunk ports on Cisco switches, representing a critical hands-on component of the CCNA certification exam.

## üîó Related Concepts (with explanations):

- **Access Port Fundamentals**:
  - **Definition**: A switch port that belongs to and carries traffic for only one VLAN
  - **Characteristics**:
    - Connects to end devices (computers, printers, access points, etc.)
    - Frames leave the port untagged (no VLAN information in the frame)
    - End device doesn't need VLAN awareness
    - Default configuration for switch ports on Cisco switches
  - **PVID (Port VLAN ID)**: VLAN assigned to an access port
  - **Default VLAN**: VLAN 1 is the default VLAN for all ports if not otherwise configured

- **Voice VLAN Configuration**:
  - **Purpose**: Allows a single physical port to support both a data device and an IP phone
  - **Operation**:
    - Data VLAN: Primary VLAN for regular data traffic
    - Voice VLAN: Secondary VLAN for voice traffic
    - IP phone places voice traffic in voice VLAN, passes data traffic from attached PC
  - **CDP/LLDP**: Used to communicate voice VLAN information to IP phones
  - **QoS Marking**: Often configured on voice VLANs for prioritization
  - **Power over Ethernet (PoE)**: Commonly used with voice VLANs to power IP phones

- **Trunk Port Fundamentals**:
  - **Definition**: Switch port that carries traffic for multiple VLANs
  - **Use Cases**:
    - Switch-to-switch connections
    - Switch-to-router connections for inter-VLAN routing
    - Switch to virtualization server (carrying multiple VLANs to VMs)
  - **Frame Tagging**: Adds VLAN identifier to Ethernet frames
  - **Trunking Protocols**:
    - **802.1Q**: Industry standard, adds 4-byte tag
    - **ISL (Inter-Switch Link)**: Cisco proprietary (legacy), encapsulates the frame

- **Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)**:
  - **Purpose**: Negotiates trunk formation between Cisco switches
  - **Modes**:
    - **dynamic auto**: Forms trunk if other side initiates (passive)
    - **dynamic desirable**: Actively attempts to form trunk (active)
    - **trunk**: Forces port to be a trunk; sends DTP advertisements
    - **access**: Forces port to be an access port; sends DTP advertisements
    - **nonegotiate**: Forces port to be trunk or access without DTP negotiation
  - **Security Considerations**: DTP can be exploited in VLAN hopping attacks
  - **Default Mode**: dynamic auto on most Cisco switches

- **Native VLAN Concept**:
  - **Definition**: VLAN whose traffic is sent untagged across a trunk
  - **Default**: VLAN 1 is the default native VLAN
  - **Purpose**: Backward compatibility with non-VLAN aware devices
  - **Security Implications**: Native VLAN mismatch can lead to security vulnerabilities
  - **Best Practice**: Change native VLAN to unused VLAN and explicitly tag all VLANs

- **VLAN Allowance on Trunks**:
  - **Default**: All VLANs (1-4094) are allowed on trunks
  - **Pruning**: Restricting specific VLANs from traversing a trunk
  - **Benefits**: Reduces unnecessary broadcast traffic, enhances security
  - **Implementation**: Manual pruning via allowed VLAN lists
  - **Dynamic Pruning**: Available through VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)

- **Port Security on Access and Trunk Ports**:
  - **Access Port Security**: Limits MAC addresses learned on the port
  - **Trunk Port Security**: Available on newer IOS versions (traditionally unavailable)
  - **Violation Modes**:
    - **shutdown**: Disables port on violation (default)
    - **restrict**: Drops packets from unknown sources, sends SNMP trap
    - **protect**: Drops packets from unknown sources, no notification
  - **MAC Address Learning**: Static configuration or dynamic "sticky" learning

- **Verification and Monitoring**:
  - **Interface Status**: Checking operational status of ports
  - **VLAN Membership**: Verifying VLAN assignments
  - **Trunk Status**: Validating trunking, encapsulation, allowed VLANs
  - **Traffic Statistics**: Monitoring utilization and errors
  - **MAC Address Learning**: Verifying proper MAC address learning on ports

  - **Port Not Assigning Correct VLAN**:
    - Verify VLAN exists in VLAN database (`show vlan brief`)
    - Check port configuration (`show interfaces switchport`)
    - Verify port is not dynamically assigned to another VLAN (VMPS/802.1X)
    - Check for macro or template overrides
    - Ensure port is not in a voice VLAN only configuration
    - Verify VLAN is active and not shutdown
    - Commands: `show vlan brief`, `show interfaces status`, `show interfaces switchport`
  
  - **Err-disabled Port**:
    - Identify cause of err-disabled state (`show interfaces status`)
    - Common causes: port security violation, BPDU Guard, loop detection
    - Check logs for specific violation (`show logging`)
    - Fix underlying issue before re-enabling
    - Re-enable with shutdown/no shutdown sequence
    - Consider automatic recovery (`errdisable recovery cause all`)
    - Commands: `show errdisable recovery`, `show port-security interface`

- **Trunk Port Problems**:
  - **Trunk Not Forming**:
    - Check configuration on both switches
    - Verify DTP modes are compatible

    - Verify encapsulation types match
    - Try static configuration without negotiation
    - Commands: `show interfaces trunk`, `show dtp interface`, `show interfaces switchport`
  
  - **VLAN Traffic Not Passing on Trunk**:
    - Verify VLAN is in allowed VLAN list (`show interfaces trunk`)
    - Check native VLAN configuration
    - Ensure VLAN exists and is active on both switches

    - Change native VLAN to unused VLAN ID
    - Consider explicitly tagging all VLANs including native
    - Monitor traffic on native VLAN
    - Check for devices sending untagged frames inadvertently
    - Commands: `show vlan id [native-vlan-id]`, `show mac address-table vlan [native-vlan-id]`

- **Systematic Troubleshooting Approach**:
  1. **Check physical connectivity** (cables, port status, errors)
  2. **Verify port configuration** matches intended purpose (access, trunk, voice)
  3. **Examine VLAN existence and status** in database
  4. **Verify trunk allowed VLANs** and native VLAN settings
  5. **Test basic connectivity** within VLAN first
  6. **Examine MAC address learning** and forwarding
  7. **Check spanning tree status** for blocked ports
  8. **Look for security features** that might be blocking traffic
  9. **Examine error logs** for port or protocol errors
  10. **Document findings** and implement solutions methodically

- **Common Configuration Errors**:
  - Configuring trunk settings on access ports
  - Mismatched native VLANs on trunk
  - Forgetting to create VLAN before assigning ports
  - Overly restrictive allowed VLAN lists on trunks
  - DTP mode mismatches
  - Forgetting to enable interfaces after configuration
  - Placing access port in nonexistent VLAN
  - Incorrect VLAN assignments for the device type
  - Applying voice VLAN configuration to non-phone ports
  - Setting port security too restrictively for the environment
