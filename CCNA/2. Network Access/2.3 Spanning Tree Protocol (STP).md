# üìò CCNA Topic: Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

## üìù Description:
Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a Layer 2 protocol that prevents loops in networks with redundant paths. Without STP, broadcast storms, MAC address table instability, and duplicate frame delivery would occur in networks with physical loops. STP uses an algorithm to identify and temporarily block redundant paths, creating a loop-free logical topology while maintaining backup paths for fault tolerance. Understanding STP operation, variants, and configuration is critical for network reliability, redundancy, and troubleshooting, making it a core component of the CCNA certification exam.

## üîó Related Concepts (with explanations):

- **STP Fundamentals and Operation**:
  - **Purpose**: Prevents Layer 2 loops in networks with redundant paths
  - **Standard**: IEEE 802.1D (original STP)
  - **Spanning Tree Algorithm (STA)**: Determines which ports should forward or block
  - **Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs)**: Control messages exchanged between switches
    - Contains Bridge ID, Root Bridge ID, Root Path Cost, Port ID
    - Sent every 2 seconds by default
  - **Root Bridge Election**: Switch with lowest Bridge ID becomes Root Bridge
    - Bridge ID = Bridge Priority (2 bytes) + MAC Address (6 bytes)
    - Default Bridge Priority: 32768 + VLAN ID
  - **Port States**:
    - **Blocking**: Does not forward frames, listens to BPDUs (20 sec)
    - **Listening**: Transitional state, processes BPDUs (15 sec)
    - **Learning**: Builds MAC table but doesn't forward frames (15 sec)
    - **Forwarding**: Normal operation, sends and receives data
    - **Disabled**: Administratively shut down
  - **Port Roles**:
    - **Root Port**: Port with best path to Root Bridge (lowest path cost)
    - **Designated Port**: Port with best path to segment (one per segment)
    - **Non-Designated Port**: Blocked ports that create loop-free topology
    - **Disabled Port**: Administratively disabled port

- **STP Path Selection Process**:
  - **Step 1**: Elect Root Bridge (lowest Bridge ID)
  - **Step 2**: Select Root Port on non-root switches
    - Lowest Root Path Cost
    - If tied, lowest Sender Bridge ID
    - If tied, lowest Sender Port ID
  - **Step 3**: Select Designated Port on each segment
    - Lowest Root Path Cost to segment
    - If tied, lowest Bridge ID
    - If tied, lowest Port ID
  - **Step 4**: Block all other ports (Non-Designated)
  - **Path Cost**: Based on link speed
    - 10 Gbps = 2
    - 1 Gbps = 4
    - 100 Mbps = 19
    - 10 Mbps = 100

- **STP Variants and Enhancements**:
  - **Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP - IEEE 802.1w)**:
    - Faster convergence (seconds instead of 50 seconds)
    - Reduced port states: Discarding, Learning, Forwarding
    - Additional port roles: Alternate and Backup
    - Explicit handshakes for state changes
    - Backwards compatible with STP
  
  - **Per-VLAN Spanning Tree Plus (PVST+)**:
    - Cisco proprietary enhancement
    - Runs separate STP instance for each VLAN
    - Allows for load balancing across links
    - Uses Cisco ISL or 802.1Q trunking
    - Backwards compatible with standard STP
  
  - **Rapid PVST+**:
    - Combines RSTP and PVST+
    - Separate RSTP instance per VLAN
    - Improved convergence with RSTP benefits
    - Higher CPU and memory requirements
  
  - **Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP - IEEE 802.1s)**:
    - Maps multiple VLANs to fewer spanning tree instances
    - Reduces CPU and memory overhead
    - Configurable MST regions
    - Combines benefits of RSTP and PVST+
    - Complex configuration requirements

- **STP Protection Features**:
  - **PortFast**: 
    - Immediately transitions access ports to forwarding state
    - Should only be used on ports connected to end devices
    - Can cause loops if connected to another switch
    - Typically enabled on all access ports
  
  - **BPDU Guard**:
    - Disables port if BPDUs are received on PortFast-enabled ports
    - Prevents loops from unauthorized switch connections
    - Port goes into err-disabled state when triggered
    - Best practice for securing access ports
  
  - **BPDU Filter**:
    - Prevents sending or receiving BPDUs on specific ports
    - Can be dangerous if misconfigured
    - Effectively disables STP on the port
    - Use with extreme caution
  
  - **Root Guard**:
    - Prevents external switches from becoming root bridge
    - Port goes into root-inconsistent state if superior BPDUs received
    - Used on ports connecting to other administrative domains
    - Automatically recovers when superior BPDUs stop
  
  - **Loop Guard**:
    - Prevents loops caused by unidirectional link failures
    - Puts port in loop-inconsistent state if BPDUs stop arriving
    - Complements UDLD functionality
    - Applied to root ports and alternate ports
  
  - **Unidirectional Link Detection (UDLD)**:
    - Detects and disables one-way communication links
    - Complements Loop Guard
    - Operates at Layer 2 by exchanging protocol packets
    - Available in normal and aggressive modes

- **STP Convergence and Timers**:
  - **Hello Time**: Interval between BPDU transmissions (2 seconds default)
  - **Forward Delay**: Time spent in listening and learning states (15 seconds each)
  - **Max Age**: Maximum BPDU age before discarding (20 seconds default)
  - **Total Convergence Time** (Traditional STP):
    - 20 seconds (Max Age) + 15 seconds (Listening) + 15 seconds (Learning) = 50 seconds
  - **RSTP Convergence**: Typically 1-2 seconds
  - **Timer Manipulation**: Possible but not recommended (can cause instability)
  - **Topology Change Notification (TCN)**: BPDUs indicating network changes
  - **Topology Change (TC) Bit**: Set in BPDUs to indicate changes

- **STP Design and Planning**:
  - **Root Bridge Placement**:
    - Centrally located in network
    - Typically in the core or distribution layer
    - Should be manually configured for control
    - Consider backup root bridge placement
  
  - **Diameter Considerations**:
    - Network diameter: Maximum number of switches between any two endpoints
    - Affects convergence time and stability
    - Default max diameter for STP: 7 switches
    - RSTP typically supports larger diameters
  
  - **VLAN STP Design**:
    - Different root bridges for different VLANs
    - Load balancing traffic across redundant links
    - Consider traffic patterns when planning
    - Document root bridge assignments
  
  - **Redundancy Planning**:
    - Multiple uplinks from access to distribution
    - Dual-homed connections where possible
    - Consider EtherChannel to increase bandwidth without adding STP complexity

## üß™ Troubleshooting Tips:

- **Root Bridge Issues**:
  - **Unexpected Root Bridge**:
    - Check Bridge IDs on all switches with `show spanning-tree`
    - Verify priority settings on intended root
    - Look for switches with manually configured low priorities
    - Check for switches with lower MAC addresses when priorities tie
    - Verify root bridge is correctly designated for each VLAN
    - Consider configuring Root Guard on edge ports
    - Implement explicit priority settings on desired root bridges
    - Commands: `show spanning-tree`, `show spanning-tree root`, `show spanning-tree bridge`
  
  - **Unstable Root Bridge**:
    - Look for frequent topology change notifications
    - Check for flapping links connected to the root
    - Verify consistent priority configuration
    - Check for duplicate Bridge IDs (rare but possible)
    - Consider increasing root bridge priority gap
    - Monitor STP events with logging or SNMP
    - Commands: `show spanning-tree detail`, `show spanning-tree statistics`

- **Port State Problems**:
  - **Port Stuck in Blocking**:
    - Verify port roles and states with `show spanning-tree interface`
    - Check if port should be blocking according to STP algorithm
    - Verify no protection features (Root Guard, Loop Guard) are active
    - Check for one-way communication issues with `show udld`
    - Consider port priority and cost configurations
    - Test with a different port or cable
    - Commands: `show spanning-tree interface`, `show interfaces status`, `show udld neighbors`
  
  - **Port Not Blocking (Creates Loop)**:
