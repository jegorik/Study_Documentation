# üìò CCNA Topic: Network Management - Automation, Controller-Based Networking, and AI

## üìù Description:
Network Management has evolved significantly with the emergence of automation, controller-based architectures, and artificial intelligence. These technologies transform how networks are designed, deployed, and maintained by reducing manual configuration, centralizing management, enabling programmability, and providing intelligent insights. This topic covers the fundamental concepts, technologies, and implementation approaches for modern network management, including network programmability, software-defined networking, intent-based networking, and AI/ML applications in networking. Understanding these concepts is essential for network professionals to build and manage scalable, agile, and resilient networks that meet today's business demands and is a key component of the CCNA certification exam.
