| 5 | Month 1 | ___/___/___ | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | |
| 6 | Month 3 | ___/___/___ | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | |

**Confidence Scale:**
- ‚≠ê = Need to restudy completely
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê = Major gaps, need significant review
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê = Some uncertainty, moderate review needed
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê = Mostly confident, light review
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê = Completely confident, ready for next interval

## üß™ Active Recall Exercises

### Daily Quick Checks (5 minutes)
```bash
# Without looking up:
1. Create a pod with alpine image
2. Expose a deployment as NodePort service
3. Scale a deployment to 3 replicas
4. Create a namespace and set context
5. List all resources in kube-system namespace
```

### Weekly Deep Dives (30 minutes)
```yaml
# Complete YAML from memory:
1. Multi-container pod with shared volume
2. NetworkPolicy with ingress/egress rules
3. PVC with specific storage requirements
4. ServiceAccount with ClusterRole binding
5. Complete application stack (deploy + service + ingress)
```

## üîß Implementation Tips

### Setting Up Your System
1. **Calendar Integration:** Add review dates to your calendar with notifications
2. **Mobile Access:** Use markdown apps for on-the-go reviews
3. **Version Control:** Track your progress with git commits
4. **Study Groups:** Share recall questions with study partners

### Adapting Intervals
- **If confidence < 3 stars:** Repeat at previous interval
- **If confidence = 5 stars:** Skip to next interval
- **Before exam (2 weeks):** Compress all intervals to daily review

### Integration with Existing Files
- **Labs:** Use spaced repetition for hands-on scenarios
- **Commands:** Apply to command reference memorization  
- **Checklists:** Review completed topics on schedule
- **MOC:** Update mastery levels in Map of Content

## üìö Scientific Background

**Forgetting Curve (Ebbinghaus):**
- Without review: 50% forgotten in 1 hour, 70% in 24 hours
- With spaced review: Retention increases to 90%+ over months

**Optimal Intervals (Research-Based):**
- 1st review: 1 day (combat initial forgetting)
- 2nd review: 3 days (strengthen neural pathways)
- 3rd review: 1 week (consolidate to long-term memory)
- 4th+ reviews: Exponentially increasing intervals

**Active Recall Benefits:**
- 2-3x more effective than passive reading
- Identifies knowledge gaps accurately
- Builds confidence under exam pressure
