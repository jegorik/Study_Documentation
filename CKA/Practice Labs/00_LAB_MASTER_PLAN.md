# CKA Practice Labs - Master Plan

## üéØ Lab Strategy Overview

This practice lab series is designed to provide **hands-on, real-world scenarios** that mirror actual CKA exam tasks and enterprise Kubernetes challenges. Each lab is self-contained, progressively complex, and focused on practical skills development.

### üìä Token-Efficient Lab Design Strategy

To optimize AI assistance while creating comprehensive labs, we'll use a **modular approach**:

1. **Bite-sized Lab Creation**: Each lab focuses on 1-2 specific exam objectives
2. **Template-based Approach**: Consistent structure reduces prompt overhead
3. **Progressive Complexity**: Basic ‚Üí Intermediate ‚Üí Advanced scenarios
4. **Cross-topic Integration**: Later labs combine multiple exam domains

## üéÆ Lab Creation Workflow

### Phase 1: Foundation Labs (Weeks 1-2)
Create basic labs from each category to establish fundamentals:
- T01, A01, N01, W01, S01

### Phase 2: Intermediate Labs (Weeks 3-5) 
Build complexity with scenario-based challenges:
- T02, T04, A02, N02, W02, S02

### Phase 3: Advanced Integration (Weeks 6-7)
Complex, multi-domain scenarios:
- T03, T07, A03, N03, W03

### Phase 4: Expert Scenarios (Week 8)
Real-world enterprise challenges:
- T08, A07, N05, W04, S03

## üîÑ Lab Execution Strategy

### Daily Practice Schedule
- **Morning (30 min)**: Review previous lab solutions
- **Evening (60 min)**: Complete 1 new lab
- **Weekend (2 hours)**: Complex integration labs

### Progress Tracking
- [ ] Completion checkboxes in each lab
- [ ] Time tracking for exam pace training  
- [ ] Difficulty rating feedback
- [ ] Integration notes for cross-topic understanding

## üõ†Ô∏è Lab Environment Requirements

### Minimum Setup
- **Local**: kind/minikube cluster
- **Cloud**: 2-node cluster (1 control plane, 1 worker)
- **Tools**: kubectl, helm, git

### Advanced Setup
- **Multi-node**: 3+ node cluster for HA scenarios
- **Storage**: Multiple storage classes available
- **Networking**: CNI with NetworkPolicy support
- **Monitoring**: Basic metrics server
