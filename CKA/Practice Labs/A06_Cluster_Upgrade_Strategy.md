sudo systemctl stop kubelet
sudo ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot restore /opt/etcd-backup/[timestamp]/etcd-snapshot.db

# Restore kubernetes configuration
sudo cp -r /opt/cluster-backup-[timestamp]/* /etc/kubernetes/

# Restart services
sudo systemctl start kubelet
```

### If Worker Node Upgrade Fails

```bash
# Isolate failed node
kubectl cordon [failed-node]
kubectl drain [failed-node] --ignore-daemonsets --force

# Rebuild node or restore from backup
# Rejoin cluster with previous version
```

---

## üìö Knowledge Check

### Critical Understanding Questions

1. **Upgrade Strategy:** Why is a staged upgrade approach recommended?
2. **High Availability:** How does HA control plane ensure zero downtime?
3. **Rollback Planning:** What components need backup before upgrade?

### Advanced Scenarios

- How would you handle custom resource definitions during upgrade?
- What's the strategy for upgrading clusters with custom CNI plugins?
- How do you validate addon compatibility with new Kubernetes versions?
