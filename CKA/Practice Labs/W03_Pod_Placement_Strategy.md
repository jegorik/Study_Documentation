## üìã Business Scenario

You're the Platform Engineer at **ShopFlow**, a major e-commerce platform preparing for Black Friday - your biggest traffic day of the year. Your infrastructure team needs to strategically place workloads across a heterogeneous cluster to ensure optimal performance, resource utilization, and fault tolerance.

The challenge: Your cluster has different node types (CPU-optimized, memory-optimized, GPU nodes) and you need to ensure that the right workloads land on the right nodes while maintaining high availability across availability zones.

**Your Mission:** Implement sophisticated pod placement strategies using node selectors, affinity rules, taints, and tolerations to create a resilient, performance-optimized deployment architecture.

**Business Impact:**
- üõí **10x traffic spike** expected (normal: 10k concurrent users ‚Üí Black Friday: 100k+)
- üí∞ **$2M+ revenue** at stake during peak 6-hour window
- üöÄ **Sub-200ms response times** required for checkout API
- üåç **99.99% availability** SLA commitment to customers
- üìä **Cost optimization** - right workloads on right (cheaper) nodes

## üîç Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**Pod Stuck in Pending State**
```bash
# Check scheduling constraints
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl get events --field-selector involvedObject.name=<pod-name>

# Common causes:
# - Node selector doesn't match any nodes
# - Insufficient resources on target nodes  
# - Taint/toleration mismatch
# - Affinity rules too restrictive
```

**Pods Not Distributed as Expected**
```bash
# Verify affinity/anti-affinity rules
kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o yaml | grep -A 10 affinity

# Check if nodes have required labels
kubectl get nodes --selector=<label-key>=<label-value>

# Validate zone distribution
kubectl get pods -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,NODE:.spec.nodeName,ZONE:.metadata.labels.topology\.kubernetes\.io/zone
```

**Resource Allocation Issues**
```bash
# Check node resource availability
kubectl describe nodes | grep -A 5 "Allocatable\|Allocated"

# Verify resource requests/limits
kubectl get pods -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,CPU-REQ:.spec.containers[0].resources.requests.cpu,MEM-REQ:.spec.containers[0].resources.requests.memory
```
